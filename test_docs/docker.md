# Docker

Docker is a containerization platform for running applications in isolated containers.

## Key Concepts

- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run software.
- **Image**: A read-only template used to create containers.
- **Dockerfile**: A text file with instructions for building a Docker image.
- **Registry**: A repository for storing and distributing Docker images.

## Common Commands

- `docker run` - Run a container from an image
- `docker build` - Build an image from a Dockerfile
- `docker pull` - Download an image from a registry
- `docker push` - Upload an image to a registry

Docker uses namespaces for isolation and cgroups for resource limits.
